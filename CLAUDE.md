## Repository Overview

This is a Zenn publication repository for technical writing in Japanese. Zenn is a Japanese technical content publishing platform where articles and books are written in Markdown and published through Git commits.

## Common Commands

### Article Management

# Create a new article
npx zenn new:article

# Preview articles and books locally (opens http://localhost:8000)
npx zenn preview

# Lint Japanese text for technical writing standards
npx textlint articles/*.md

# Lint all markdown files
npx textlint "**/*.md"
```

### Package Management
This project uses pnpm as the package manager:
```bash
pnpm install
```

## Code Architecture

### Directory Structure
- `/articles/` - Individual technical articles in Markdown format with YAML frontmatter
- `/books/` - Technical books organized in directories with chapters and config.yaml
- `/demo/` - Example code and projects referenced in articles (Go, Kotlin, Rust, etc.)
- `/docs/` - Contains writing style guidelines
- `/references/` - Reference materials for articles
- `/vhs/` - Demo recordings and GIFs

### Article Format
Articles use YAML frontmatter:
```yaml
---
title: "Article Title"
emoji: "üêº"
type: "tech" # or "idea"
topics: ["go", "grpc", "testing"]
published: true # or false
---
```

### Book Structure
Each book directory contains:
- `config.yaml` - Book metadata and chapter ordering
- `cover.png` - Book cover image
- Numbered markdown files (1.md, 2.md, etc.) - Chapters

## Writing Guidelines

Based on the author's established style:
- Primary focus: Go backend development, gRPC, testing, clean architecture
- Writing approach: Practical, step-by-step explanations with clear objectives
- Frequently uses üêº emoji and maintains a humble, approachable tone
- Articles typically include: objectives, target audience, prerequisites, and summaries

## Textlint Configuration

The repository uses Japanese technical writing linters:
- `textlint-rule-preset-ja-technical-writing` - Technical writing standards
- `textlint-rule-preset-jtf-style` - Japan Technical Communicators Forum style guide

These ensure consistent, professional Japanese technical documentation.
